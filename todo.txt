bugs
villagers do not bring back things after filling their inventories in CONTRIBUTE
player spawns in a villager camp or maybe the other way round, mapping is not correct
game breaks when villager count is > 7

QA
make sure replication and max cap works

improvements
slow down NPCs actions so you can see them better
show NPC target in debug string

- some emojis broken on Mac/Safari
- no feedback on stealing -> bad
- too much lag (sometimes)!
- get stuck in tight passages
- feedback when it gets night and you get cold!
- feedback on when you get too hungry/thirsty (like NPCs)
- cannot drop items
- add some deadly aninals that kill you (lions etc) at a certain sight range, reduce your health
- explain that force field is door
- does not notice that you get a different world every time -> EXPLAIN!
- thinks that color and/or size defines what makes a forcefield deadly (make all the same?)
- REMIND that others know things -> death message? other times?
- make NPCs feel smart by "inner monologue"?
- NPCs can go through deadly force fields -> BUG!
- feels lonely and disconnected, game allows no interaction with NPCs, alienating, they feel hostile
- wanted to know where things go, colors are interesting, can I find my way back home, push your luck in going further, was fun to follow an NPC back home (he's useful now, building a relation)
- find ways that NPCs can help you
- find ways you can help NPCs
- weird that NPCs do not interact with other
- after you die bring back the intro screen, NEVER skip it!
- find a connection with the people -> Pippo's Wunschziel, turn into actor into observer, community member
- survive is a pretense, but you want to become a part of the community!
- different things are safe at some time of day! (bugs and snaker are sleeping, bring the moskito repellant)
- deadly animals should exist and run away when they sense two NPCs/player in the same area
