bugs
villagers do not bring back things after filling their inventories in CONTRIBUTE
player spawns in a villager camp or maybe the other way round, mapping is not correct
game breaks when villager count is > 7

QA
make sure replication and max cap works

improvements
slow down NPCs actions so you can see them better
show NPC target in debug string
