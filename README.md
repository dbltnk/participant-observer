# Participant Observer Prototype

**What is this?**

A sci-fi survival game prototype exploring *social learning* as the core mechanic. You play as a stranded survivor on an alien world, learning to survive not just by trial and error, but by *watching and imitating* AI villagers. Every world is unique, and thriving means learning from others, not just yourself.

**Current State (V1.5):**
- Procedural world & nutrition: Each seed = new survival puzzle
- Smart villagers: Hierarchical AI, resource memory, "golden rule" foraging
- Social learning: Players can observe villagers to learn safe paths, resource patterns, and animal behaviors
- Biomes, pathfinding, fog of war, and a basic UI

**What's missing:**
- Villagers don't actively teach or show symptoms from mistakes
- No player journal, hypothesis system, or conversations
- No advanced resource/seasonal systems or movement systems
- Visuals are placeholders, UX is the worst, no audio etc.

**Tech:** Phaser 3, emoji-based rendering, config-driven, runs in browser (desktop/laptop, not mobile)

**Status:**
Prototype demonstrates the *core social learning loop* and technical foundation. Deep knowledge-sharing and "going beyond the status quo" are future work.
